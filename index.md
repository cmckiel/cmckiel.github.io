I’m an embedded software engineer exploring how to design systems that are both fast to build and safe to trust. My work ranges from bare-metal drivers and HALs to drones, EVs, and autonomy experiments — projects that teach me how to scale reliability without slowing down innovation. I share the process openly so others can learn from the patterns, tradeoffs, and failures along the way.
